BaumKrone Berlin is a web application built using create-react-app, by Freja Smith.

## A Seasonal Website

BaumKrone Berlin is a tree surgery business. Since their work is largely dictated by the seasons I wanted to bring some of this seasonality to the design. I decided to incorporate a lunar calendar via [Suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) and have this influence the style.

The design includes 12 x 2-colour themes, one for each month. Each new theme changes to the next with the new moon.

## Future Designs

I plan to also develop the following features:
- A switch for users to select a muted colour palette in case they find the colours overwhelming, with a dark/ light mode choice.
- A function that sets the stronger colour as the background during the night, and the lighter colour during the day.
- A function that changes the header image to another seasonal image each month.
