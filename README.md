## BaumKrone Business Website

BaumKrone Berlin is a web application built using create-react-app, by Freja Smith. I have utilised code from the (Saxon Date project)[https://github.com/realjhoo/saxon-date-web], by Jerry Hoover.

## A Seasonal Website

BaumKrone Berlin is tree surgery business. Since their work is largely dictated by the seasons I wanted to bring this feature to the website. I decided to use a traditional lunar calendar system, the Saxon calendar, to calculate time because this is more closely related to the natural environment and seasonal events that trees respond to.

Currently I am only using this calendar to display today's Saxon date in the footer, however I plan to develop a colour scheme that fluctuates according to the current Saxon month.
